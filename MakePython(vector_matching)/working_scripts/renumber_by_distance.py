'''

1. pick a directional axis to order different objects
2. numerically rename and order a certain group of objects depending on 
    where they are located along the chosen axis

    e.g. a snake figure composed of thousands of smaller, separate objects
    facing the positive x direction;
    use this script to rename each object with the smaller numbers
    in the negative-most x direction, and the largest numbers in the 
    positive-most direction
    
this script is to be used in conjunction with keyframe_trace, so that
an iterative script can animate these objects in order
